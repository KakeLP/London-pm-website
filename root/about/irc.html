    <h2>Where is the IRC channel?</h2><div class="item">

    <h2>What is a bot?</h2><div class="item">
        <p>A bot is a program that responds to events on IRC (like people speaking) with useful information.</p>

        <p>There's an informal convention on #london.pm that bots receive voice (+v) but not ops (+o), so you can tell them from people who will either be opped or unopped, but rarely have voice.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>What is dipsy?</h2><div class="item">
        <p>dipsy is an <a href="http://www.infobot.org/">infobot</a> that acts as a kind of community memory. For example, you can say to dipsy <tt>dipsy, next meeting?</tt> and it will tell you when the meeting is.</p>

        <p>In addition, dipsy measures 'karma', which can be given or removed by saying the name of something followed by ++ or --. You can also give a reason for this after a comment tag (#) which will be stored. For example, <pre>dipsy++ # knows things
(my computer)-- # a bit rubbish really
</pre></p>

        <p>You can find out the karma of an item by asking <tt>dipsy, karma dipsy</tt> and you can find out why something has the karma it has by asking <tt>dipsy, explain karma netscape</tt>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>What is slavorg?</h2><div class="item">
        <p>People on #london.pm usually have ops. slavorg is a bot to keep it that way, by opping people whom it trusts. It also gives voice to bots it believes.</p>
    </div>
